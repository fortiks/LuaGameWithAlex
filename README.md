# LuaProject 

This project is inspired by the childhood game Motherload, but with a 3D twist. The goal of the game is to dig through the earth, collecting valuable resources while avoiding various dangers and obstacles. As you progress, you can upgrade your player by purchasing better damage, armor, and other enhancements to improve your chances of survival. But don't forget to "tank" and prepare for the final battle, as youâ€™ll eventually need to defeat the boss to complete your mission/win the game.

# Things to Improve (If Desired) 
- Collision Detection: Enhancing the game's collision system for more accurate interactions between the player and the environment.
- Map Reading: Improving the system to correctly read and generate only parts of the map as needed, instead of loading the entire map at once. This would help optimize performance
- Texture Implementation: Adding textures to objects and terrain to make the visuals more realistic and immersive.
- Animation: Implementing more advanced animation systems for player and object movements to bring the world to life.
- Fix issues with button functionality
