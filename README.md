# Things to Improve (If Desired) 
- Collision Detection: Enhancing the game's collision system for more accurate interactions between the player and the environment.
- Map Reading: Improving the system to correctly read and generate only parts of the map as needed, instead of loading the entire map at once. This would help optimize performance
- Texture Implementation: Adding textures to objects and terrain to make the visuals more realistic and immersive.
- Animation: Implementing more advanced animation systems for player and object movements to bring the world to life.
